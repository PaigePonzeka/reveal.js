					<aside class="notes">
						So I'm going to talk to you about Sass. A lovely simple front-end technology that is often overlooked and why you can use it to make writing CSS less terrible and less annoying.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- Slide 2 Introduction-->
				<section data-transition="convex">
					<h2>Who Are You?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">My name is Paige</li>
						<li class="fragment">a Front-end Engineer</li>
						<li class="fragment">on the Platypus Application Platform Team</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						For those of you that don't know me. My name is Paige I'm a front-end Engineer here at Yext. I when to NYU in New York City and I started working at a consulting company in NY right out of college. They were using Sass in their code when I started. So I only write in vanilla CSS if I absolutely have to. And When I do I absolutely friggin hate it
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- Slide - Why Does CSS Suck? -->
				<section data-transition="convex">
					<h2>Writing Vanilla CSS Sucks</h2>
					<img src="./images/writing_css.gif"/>
					<aside class="notes">Writing Vanilla CSS Sucks. It's repetitive. You have to write the same classes over and over again. It's time consuming. There's no concept of nesting. Need to change the color of something? Hopefully you used consisten colors, because you're only option is to use Find & Replace. There's no concept of variables in CSS. Trying to maintain vanilla CSS on an entire platform is a nightmare. So they've come up with some solutions and one of those include Sass.</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- Slide - What the Hell is Sass -->
				<section>
					<section data-transition="zoom">
						<h2>So Let's Use Sass</h2>
						<p>But what the hell is it?</p>
						<blockquote class="fragment highlight-blue">"It's CSS With super powers."</blockquote>
						<blockquote class="fragment highlight-green">"It makes CSS fun again."</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes"> So What the hell is Sass? Some might say "It's CSS with super powers." Sure. Others say is "Makes CSS fun again." I mean I guess. </aside>
					</section>


					<!-- Subslide - What the hell is Sass -->	
					<section data-transition="zoom">
						<h2>Sass is a CSS preprocessor</h2>
						<img class="fragment" src="./images/coolshit.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">Sass is a CSS preprocessor. It's a scripting language  that extends CSS. I like to think that it makes writing CSS not suck. Sass Gives CSS the power of nesting, variables, functions, mixins, inline partials. And those features let you write some pretty cool shit.</aside>
					</section>

					<!-- Subslide - What the hell is Sass - Nesting-->
					<section data-transition="concave">
						<h2>Nesting</h2>
							<ul class="side-by-comparison">
								<li><img src="./images/table-css.png"/></li>
								<li class="fragment"><img src="./images/table-scss.png"/></li>
							</ul>
						<aside class="notes">Nesting in Sass makes your CSS easier to read and maintain. It gives you a visual hierarchy. So you can go from something like this table css. To this Table.scss. </aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h1>The Inception Rule</h1>
						<p>Don't go more than four levels deep</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Be careful to limit your nests. Generally speaking you should nest over 4 times otherwise that will result in overqualified CSS that will be hard to override and maintain.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<!-- Slide - Ampersand -->
				<section data-transition="concave">
					<h2>& - Ampersand</h2>

					<ul class="side-by-comparison">
						<li><img src="./images/ampersand.png"/></li>
						<li class="fragment"><img src="./images/ampersand-compiled.png"/></li>
					</ul>
					
					<aside class="notes">Ampersand is used when nesting. It tells Sass to pull down any parent selector into the child selector. For example: This link code above can be used with these psuedo classes to create this compiled css. Nested selectors don't have to start with the &. They can also end with the ampersand which will put the parent selector as a child. </aside>
				</section>
				<!-- TODO Add a slide for ampersand to the child-->

				<!-- Slide Organize to Partials -->
				<section data-transition="fade-in">
					<h2>Partials</h2>
					<img src="./images/dam-scss.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Using inline imports we can organize our SCSS files into partial files just as we do with our html templates. Partials are generally, denoted with an underscore. It also lets us import shared content across, shown by the lib/meta file here which is a partial that contains all our storm wide vars, mixins, and compass imports. More on that later.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2> Functions</h2>
					<img src="./images/function.png"/>
					<img src="./images/function-call.png"/>
					<aside class="notes"> 
					We actually don't use these very often and I couldn't find an instance of this in our Sass code. It's very similar to another directive I'm going to show you called a mixin. Except instead of generating CSS (which is what a mixin does) it returns a value and it's simple called by its function name. 
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- Slide - Variables -->
				<section>

					<!-- Slide - Variables colors --> 
					<section >
						<h3>The Power of Variables: A Scenario</h3>
						<img class="fragment" src="./images/50Shades.jpg"/>
						<aside class="notes">So Say, after spending a number of late nights at the office for various reasons. Yext CEO Howard has decided that, for some reason, he feels really inspired to remove all of the colors in Storm and replace them with various shades of gray. Maybe 50 Shades.
						If all of our code was written in CSS and we didn't use variables for our colors. We would have to find and replace all instances of the hexidecimal colors. You'd have to manually comb through hundreds and maybe thousands of lines of code.
						</aside>				
					</section>

					<!-- Slide - Variables colors --> 
					<section>
						<h2>This actually happened</h2>
						<img src="./images/colors-scss.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">So this actuallly happened before. We were using Sass at the time but we didn't assign any of our colors to varialbles so I had to do just that and Comb through thousands of lines of CSS, find every instance of a color and change it. I spent a pretty long time changing one shade of gray to a different shade of gray. It was wonderful. But I made sure when I did it I added variables to our color assignments. You can see the colors in the _color.scss files. Pictured here.</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
						<img src="./images/colors-vars.png"/>
						<aside class="notes"> 
							Also Note that I named the variables to include their colors names. That wouldn't be useful if we needed to change the colors later, since it would be confusing if $brand-blue was actually gray later on. Instead I made them colors that were obvious to a user what they could be. So for usability to other developers initial variables are names after their colors. But then when they are used in CSS for example $color-location-cms is to indicate the color is it on the navigation bar and even without being familar with storm I can know its some shade of blue.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<!-- Slide - Variables colors --> 
					<section>
						<h3>And if we change again?</h3>
						<img src="./images/orangeisthenewblack.jpg"/>
						<aside class="notes">If Howard ever feels that itch of inspiration again. We can change all of the colors of storm but just changing a few lines in the _color.scss partial and deploying are changes. As long as everyone else working in the SASS had been using the color variables.</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sass Operations</h2>
					<img src="./images/number-function.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Sass has some built in helper math operations that can be very useful. You can find the documention at sass-lang.com. It can do basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, division. There's also some number functions, String functions and color functions that can be helpful say if you wanted to lighten or darken a color for an accent. You can just pass in a color an a percentage and it will darken it for you. I actually use those one's a lot.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<!-- Slide Let's Refactor -->
				<section>
					<h1>Let's make our code better</h1>
					<aside class="notes">We know some of the basics of Sass. Now lets refactor some living and breathing Storm Sass code to use some of the more powerful features. Starting with mixins.</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- Prescence builder refactor -->
				<section>
					<!-- Slide: Prescence builder original -->
					<section>
						<img src="images/prescence-builder-original.png" />
						<aside notes="notes">Here's an for example from Prescence builder. There's some Repetitive Code here. But We can fix that. Let's use some mixins to clean this up. First let's take note of a couple things. There are variables used for the background image. Which I've already seen stores the url in a variables partial. Let's create our Mixin. </aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h1>What is a @mixin?</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
						I guess we should know what a mixin is first. Mixins are created using the @mixin directive. It can include arguments (but it doesn't have to), you can set defaults, and it can even take blocks of css. Storm Mixins live in the _mixin.scss partial. Now. let's take a look at our new Mixin.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<!-- Slide: Mixins -->
					<section>
						<h2>@mixin</h2>
						<img src="images/pb-refactor-mixins.png" />
						<aside class="notes"> You can see a $full-star (at the end of the arguments) has a default value set to $iconStarBlue so if we don't set it in any of our calls it will automatically be assigned. Then we can just simply call the mixin from our Sass file.</aside>
					</section>
					<!-- Slide: Mixin Call -->
					<section>
						<h2>@include the Mixin</h2>
						<img src="images/pb-refactor-stars.png" />
						<aside class="notes">We can call the mixin with @include declartion and send it our variables just like you would call a function.</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<!-- Slide: Refactoring with For Loops -->
				<section>
					<h2>Refactoring with For Loops</h2>
					<ul class="side-by-comparison">
						<li><img src="./images/icons-before.png"/></li>
						<li class="fragment" style="width: 465px;"><img src="./images/icons-refactor.png"/></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Sass also supports loops which can come in handy for situations like this. Using for loops we can limit this Stars Sass to just a couple lines. The refactor is pretty straight forward here. It loops from 1 to ten and generates the star value and the width of the background image.</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- Slide: Maps. Mixins, Loops, If/Else  -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Refactoring Partner Icons</h2>
						<img src="./images/partner-logos.gif"/>
						<aside class="notes">Here's a big one. This is over a hundred lines for the Partner Logos on the Social Page located in the _icon.scss partial. There's two different sized sets of Icons, 20px and 30px. They've followed a naming convention for the files, which is really nice actualy. That will make this a really quick refactor.</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Refactoring Partner Icons - Map</h4>
						<img src="./images/partner-logos-map.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">Sass also supports maps. Here is a Simple map we can put in the _vars.scss partial. It just maps the partner Ids to their respective names and we can use a loop to iterate over the map in our mixin.</aside>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<h4>Refactoring Partner Icons - Mixins</h4>
						<img src="./images/partner-logos-mixins.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">This is the partner-logos mixin that could live in the _mixins.scss partial. The only thing it needs is the dimensions of the logo, it uses the file naming convention we saw earlier to generate the names of the partner logos in a few lines.
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Refactoring Partner Icons - Includes</h4>
						<img src="./images/partner-logos-call.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							And here's the call we make to generate each of the logo sizes. Cutting down a few hundred lines and making it much easier to add addition partner icons later. 
						</aside>
					</section>

				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h1>@extend</h1>
						<aside class="notes"> Let's take a break from refactoring to take a look at another powerful Sass feature.

						@extend is another nifty directive in Sass. It allows you to share rules between selectors and it groups extend selectors together.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>We use @extend heavily in the Storm buttons</h4>
						<img src="./images/extends-buttons.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">You can see it in action here in the _buttons partial. You might ask yourself why do you have btn-orange and btn-blue if all of the storm buttons are gray. Well remember that 50 Shades of Grey scenario i mentioned earlier? An old branding of Storm had different colored buttons for different actions. When we rebranded we got rid of those buttons and shifted to all gray buttons (minus the warning button). To keep compatibility with old styles and to potentinally keep from breaking any javascript that might happen to use those styling classes for their code I kept the classes around and just inherited style from other buttons. 

						(Also for the record, never use a styling class as a JQuery selector, whether or not I want a dark gray or light gray button shouldn't also affect whether the buttons runs an ajax call or not)</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Compiled CSS using @extends</h3>
						<img src="./images/buttons-compiled.png"/>
						<aside class="notes"> Anyway back to some CSS. 
							I deleted some of the actual compiled CSS just so you can see what's going on but here's an example of a compiled CSS from the @extend directive. Here you can see that .btn-action and .btn-orange are no side by side. This is BASICALLY what @extend does. It creates the idea of inheritence in Sass but instead of duplicating the CSS and having it in both places it comma seperates the original selector and applys the styles more effiently. Great. Except.
						</aside>
					</section>
					
					<section data-background="./images/shame.gif">
						<h2>@extend does bad things sometimes</h2>
						<aside class="notes">@extend does bad things sometimes. It doesn't always work the way you expect it to. And can lead to generating some pretty hefty selectors. Let's take a look at one example.</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>Styling the button later</h4>
						<img src="./images/buttons-extend-bad.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">Say, after using @extend on the action-button class. We wanted to later style the action button in a sidebar on a page. Maybe we had a sidebar and the button needed padding for some reason and I also wanted to change what it does when the user hovers over the button. Obviously you could do something like this and just make .btn-action a child of sidebar and add my custom stying. Does anyone have an idea what this would compile to?</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h4>What it compiles to:</h4>
						<img src="./images/buttons-extend-bad-compiled.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">It generates into something like this, which is a bit unexpected and if you need custom styles on your extend button class a lot or if you extend it in a lot of places. These selectors will grow larger and larger and bloat are compiled CSS. Which is what we don't want.</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>What can we do about this?</h3>
						<img class="fragment" src="./images/player-three.jpg"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							There's one fix it to just turn the shared styling into a mixin and include it on both classes. That will duplicate the CSS and put it in bother places. There's another way we can do it with the @extend directive.And luckily for us. The creators of Sass introduced a new directive to address this very problem. Meet Placeholders.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>%Placeholders</h3>
						<img src="./images/placeholders.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">Instead of using a period infront of the extended class, you can use the percent sign and that prevents the selector from being inserted into the CSS. Now only extended selectors will be included in the CSS. Here's an example where I created %btn-action-pl a placeholder that is extended by both btn-action and .btn-orange.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>That compiles to:</h3>
						<img src="./images/placeholders-compiled.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">
						This compiles to the above CSS.
						That's a little bit more of what we expected. Notice that .btn-orange is no longer called in the code for the sidebar. We actually currently don't use placeholders in Storm buttons but maybe we should probably consider it.
						</aside>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Compass</h2>
					<aside class="notes">Now on to compass. It is calls the jQuery for Stylesheets. It's a library of CSS functions and patterns that make it easier for getting started.</aside>
